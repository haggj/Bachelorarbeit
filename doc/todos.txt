TODO:
1.1
- compare KEM and KEX

1.2
- details about quantum computers, why are they faster?
- details about shors algorithm
- describe kem and public key system


2
- illustrate SIDH APIs for each library
- SIDH natrual candidate to replace modern Diffie-Hellman


Measures for efficiency

	- comparision among SIDH

		Overall
		generic optimized
		x64 optimized
		compressed

		execution hotspots based on library:
			sike
			pq-crypo
			circl

	- comoparison between SIDH and ECDH

		overall
		ecdh hotspots

Security analysis

	- constant time, standard derivation
		sike
		pq-crypto
		circl
		ecdh
		
	- key length
