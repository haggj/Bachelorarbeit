Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) is a key exchange protocol based on isogenies between supersingular elliptic curves. Isogeny-based cryptography is a candidate to resist quantum computers. Thus, SIDH  could replace currently deployed Diffie-Hellman protocols whose security could be compromised by quantum computers in future.\\
This thesis introduces currently available SIDH impelementations: \textit{SIKE}, \textit{PQCrypto-SIDH}, \textit{CIRCL} and \textit{SIKE for Java} and benchmarks those based on memory and speed. \textit{SIKE} and \textit{PQCrypto-SIDH} share common source code leading to almost equivalent benchmarking results. The performance of \textit{SIKE for Java} is out of competition due to the just-in-time compiler architecture of the JVM.\\
While the developed benchmarking suite indicates \textit{SIKE} as the library executing the least instructions for \textit{x64 optimized} algorithms, while \textit{CIRCL} executes less instructions for \textit{generic optimized} algorithms. For all implementations \textit{SIKE} allocates the least memory. The comparison with a modern Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman library (\textit{OpenSSL}) demonstrates the limitations of current SIDH algorithms. In particular the difference in terms of the execution times for a single key exchange is remarkable.
