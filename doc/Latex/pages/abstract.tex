This thesis benchmarks and compares currently available Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman impelementations: \textit{SIKE}, \textit{PQCrypto-SIDH} and \textit{CIRCL}. While the developed benchmarking suite indicates \textit{PQCrypto-SIDH} as the library executing the least amount of instructions for a single SIDH key exchange, \textit{SIKE} allocates least memory. \textit{CIRCL} demands the most resources (execution time and memory) among the compared libraries. The comparison with a modern Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman library (\textit{OpenSSL}) demonstrates the limitations of current SIDH algorithms in terms of execution time for a single key exchange.
