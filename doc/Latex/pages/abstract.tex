This thesis describes currently available Supersingular Isogeny Diffie-Hellman (SIDH) impelementations: \textit{SIKE}, \textit{CIRCL} and \textit{SIKE for Java}. 
The performance of \textit{SIKE} and \textit{CIRCL} are benchmarked in detail: 
While the developed benchmarking suite indicates \textit{SIKE} as the library executing the least amount of instructions for \textit{x64 optimized} algorithms, \textit{CIRCL} executes less instructions for \textit{generic optimized} algorithms. For all implementations \textit{SIKE} allocates less memory. The comparison with a modern Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman library (\textit{OpenSSL}) demonstrates the limitations of current SIDH algorithms in terms of execution time for a single key exchange.
