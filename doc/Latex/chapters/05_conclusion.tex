\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}

This final chapter summarizes all results of the benchmarking suite. For a detailed analysis of the measured data see \autoref{chapter:analysis} and addenda \ref{app:detailed_benchmarks}. The presented data in this chapter provides a relative comparison between the SIDH libraries \textit{SIKE}, PQ-\textit{Crypto} and \textit{CIRCL}. Moreover, the relative difference between SIDH and ECDH is shown.\\
The most efficient implementation in the following tables is highlighted in green and has a relative difference of 1 to itself. All other implementations in the appropriate row are labeled with the relative distance to the most efficient implementation. For this evaluation the execution times and memory consumption for a whole Diffie-Hellman exchange are accumulated (key generation of A and B \textit{plus} secret generation of A and B).

\subsubsection{Comparing SIDH libraries}

The values in \autoref{tab:conclusion_p434} indicate \textit{PQ-Crypto} as the fastest library for \textit{x64}, \textit{x64 compressed} and \textit{generic compressed} implementations, while \textit{SIKE} is little faster for the \textit{generic} variant. \textit{CIRCL} only provides an \textit{x64} implementation and is much slower than \textit{SIKE} and \textit{PQ-Crypto}.

\end{table}

On the contrary, \textit{SIKE} allocates less memory than \textit{PQ-Crypto} for all implementations, especially for both \textit{compressed} versions \textit{PQ-Crypto} demands clearly more memory. Again, \textit{CIRCL} request the most resources.

\subsubsection{Comparing SIDH and ECDH}

The analysis of \autoref{tab:conclusion_ecdh_sidh} reveals the differences between \textit{SIDH} and \textit{ECDH} in terms of execution times. Note that all security classes and only the x64 optimized variants of all libraries are considered.\\
While the overhead of \textit{SIDH} for the security level AES128 (matches NIST security level 1 and p434) is enormous the relative difference for higher security levels decreases. However, ECDH requests slightly more memory than SIDH (see \autoref{chapter:analysis}).
